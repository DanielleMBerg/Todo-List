# Todo-List
Interactive Todo List that allows you to add tasks and remove tasks.

The basics of the code was provided to me by my MIT course. I added all of the styling, imported Bootstrap components, and duplicated components so that it wasn't just one list but one list for each day of the week.

# How to Run
To run on your own device, download all the files (except for the LICENSE file and the README file) and save them in one folder. Run the files on your local server using http-server.

# Future Improvements
I would like to fix a few things: instead of removing the task I want to strikethrough the task when it is completed, I also want to fix the spacing issues that occur when tasks are added.

# License
See the attached LICENSE file.
